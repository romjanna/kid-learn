    "content": "Addition is one of the basic operations in math. When we add two numbers together, we get a sum. For example, 2 + 3 = 5. Think of it like putting two groups of apples together and counting them all!\n\n## Key Concepts\n- The **plus sign** (+) means we are adding\n- The **equals sign** (=) shows the result\n- The numbers being added are called **addends**\n- The result is called the **sum**\n\n## Examples\n- 1 + 1 = 2\n- 5 + 3 = 8\n- 10 + 7 = 17",

    "content": "Photosynthesis is how plants make their own food using sunlight. It's one of the most important processes on Earth!\n\n## How It Works\n1. Plants absorb **sunlight** through their leaves\n2. They take in **carbon dioxide** (CO2) from the air\n3. They absorb **water** from the soil through their roots\n4. Using sunlight energy, they convert these into **glucose** (sugar) and **oxygen**\n\n## The Equation\nSunlight + Water + Carbon Dioxide → Glucose + Oxygen\n\n## Why It Matters\n- Plants produce the **oxygen** we breathe\n- It's the base of most **food chains**\n- It removes **CO2** from the atmosphere",
